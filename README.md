## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome Icons
- [Flow Type](https://flow.org/en/) - JS type checker
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
### Continued development

I think I overcomplicated myself by using a typechecker, but I did cause I wanted to experiment with it. My solution is far from perfect, in fact I still didnt add hover animations for the social media icons and on iOS devices running Safari, the email input automatically zooms in, breaking a little bit the UX of the site and thats a bug i would like to solve.

### Useful resources

- [Stephen C. Weiss](https://stephencharlesweiss.com/better-form-submissions-with-event-preventdefault-and-htmlformelement-reset/) - This helped me in a previous design challenge that involved form validation, I find this pattern highly useful for form validation on submit.

## Acknowledgments

I was tremendously aided by the StackOverflow community that perhaps didn't help me directly, but some questions other users asked guided me through the process.
